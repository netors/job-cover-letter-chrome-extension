## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### JavaScript
- **ES6+**: Use modern JavaScript features
- **Async/Await**: Prefer over Promises chains
- **Error Handling**: Always include try-catch blocks
- **Comments**: Comment complex logic and API interactions

```javascript
// Good example
async function generateCoverLetter(jobData, settings) {
  try {
    console.log('üöÄ Generating cover letter...');
    const result = await aiService.generate(jobData, settings);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå Generation failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

#### CSS
- **Consistent Naming**: Use kebab-case for CSS classes
- **Mobile First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **CSS Variables**: Use for colors and spacing
- **Comments**: Document complex selectors and layouts

#### HTML
- **Semantic HTML**: Use appropriate HTML5 elements
- **Accessibility**: Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- **Responsive**: Design for all screen sizes

### Chrome Extension Best Practices

#### Manifest V3 Compliance
- **Service Workers**: Use background service workers, not background pages
- **Permissions**: Request minimal necessary permissions
- **Content Security Policy**: Follow strict CSP guidelines

#### Security
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit API keys or tokens
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs
- **Secure Storage**: Use Chrome storage APIs properly

### Git Workflow

#### Branch Naming
- **Features**: `feature/description` (e.g., `feature/claude-integration`)
- **Bug Fixes**: `fix/description` (e.g., `fix/job-detection-linkedin`)
- **Documentation**: `docs/description` (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)

#### Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

feat(popup): add Claude model selection
fix(detection): resolve LinkedIn job parsing issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(storage): improve data persistence logic
```

#### Pull Request Process
1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes and Commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(scope): your descriptive message"
   ```

3. **Push to Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create Pull Request**
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch and provide detailed description
